# Grafana Work to build monitoring using Docker, Telegraf, Influxdb, Grafana and etc.


## Getting Started
Follow the following instructions to setup a Telegraf, Influxdb, Grafana in docker:

### Installing
Follow the instructions given below:
1) Explicitly create volumes grafana-volume & influxdb-volume and network monitoring
2) Since volumes were created so the following dummy docker run will set appropriate users (e.g. admin, telegraf)  and create database (e.g. telegraf) in influxdb  
```
docker run --rm \
-e INFLUXDB_DB=telegraf 
-e INFLUXDB_ADMIN_ENABLED=true \
-e INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER=admin -e INFLUXDB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \
-e INFLUXDB_USER=telegraf -e INFLUXDB_USER_PASSWORD=telegraf \
-v influxdb-volume:/var/lib/influxdb \
influxdb /init-influxdb.sh 
```
3) Spin up containers using docker compose file
